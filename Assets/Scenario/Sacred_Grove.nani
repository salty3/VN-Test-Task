# Ellina_Intro

@char Ellina
Ellina: Good to see you, {PlayerName}. We have troubling news.
Ellina: An ancient artifact has awakened. If it falls into the wrong hands, it could bring disaster.
Ellina: Seek out the Seeress Tarya — she hides in the old temple to the east. She knows what must be done.

# Final_Choice

@char Ellina
@char Tarya

Narrator: As you return with the rune, you see both Ellina and Tarya waiting for you.
Ellina: {PlayerName}, you're back. We feared the worst.
Tarya: You have it, don't you? The rune... and the artifact.
Narrator: They both step forward. The air is tense.
Ellina: Listen, {PlayerName}, this power must be protected — not studied!
Tarya: Protected? Or locked away forever? Let me understand it — we can use it for good.
Narrator: You have to choose...
